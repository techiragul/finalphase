# Product Demand Prediction for Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts product demand based on historical data. It helps businesses optimize their inventory management and make data-driven decisions regarding production, pricing, and supply chain management.

## Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (version X.X)
- Required Python libraries (list them, e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (if using the provided notebooks)
- Data: Sample historical sales data (provide instructions on how to obtain the data)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techiragul/finalphase

Navigate to the project directory:
cd product-demand-prediction
Install the required Python libraries using pip (or conda if using Anaconda):
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Data Preparation
Before running the code, you need to prepare your historical sales data. Make sure you have a CSV file containing at least the following columns: Date, ProductID, Quantity Sold, and any relevant features (e.g., price, promotions).
2. Running the Model
You can use the Jupyter Notebook provided (e.g., demand_prediction.ipynb) to step through the process interactively or run the Python script directly.
Using Jupyter Notebook:
•	Start Jupyter Notebook:
                jupyter notebook
•	Open the demand_prediction.ipynb notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.
Using Python script:
•	Execute the Python script from the command line:
          python demand_prediction.py --data_path /path/to/your/data.csv
Make sure to replace /path/to/your/data.csv with the path to your prepared dataset.
Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of historical sales data for a range of products. Each entry in the dataset includes the following information:
•	Date: The date of the transaction.
•	ProductID: A unique identifier for each product.
•	Quantity Sold: The quantity of the product sold on the given date.
•	Additional features (e.g., price, promotions): Any additional relevant information that can impact product demand.

Configuration
You can modify the model's hyperparameters and configuration in the config.py file. Adjust parameters like the choice of machine learning algorithm, training periods, and the target variable.
Results
Include information on where the model's results or predictions will be stored. If applicable, describe how to interpret the results and how to visualize them.
